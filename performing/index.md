## **Writing and Making Meet in Performance**, my oldest practice

Raised among <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/songs-of-america/articles-and-essays/musical-styles/ritual-and-worship/shape-note-singing/" target="_blank"><i>shape note singers</i></a>, in a fundamentalist and very-much _fellow_-ship, I, from an early age, performed _live, on stage_ —whether reading the scripture for the Sunday Sermon or leading the _a cappella_ singing (in four part harmony) for which our sect is justly famous...  
Or, a favorite, as part of the _puppet ministry_ of Vacation Bible School, I have been, all unseen, before audiences since I was in short pants.   

As a puppeteer (naming my alter ego _Melvin J. Pickles_) I learned to improvise. It was in this persona that I devised, on the spot, my first joke...

While torturing the live MC with my _bants_, the kid —just a couple years older than me— complained comically: 
_Mr. Pickles, you're gonna give me a_ complex!  
In the moment, I replied: 

> Aw, you're too simple to have a complex! 

And, ok, now that I write it out, I feel like I copped it from an episode of _The Jeffersons_... But what a moment! It _sold_ me. I'd _paralyzed_ the guy!

## **Singing and Storytelling:** the US and Abroad  

In the approach to my highschool graduation, I qualified to join the Texas All State Choir at about the same time I'd planned a trip to India. The choice wasn't difficult.  

A couple years earlier, an exchange student from _Andhra Pradesh_ had spent a year in our weird little Christian School —while remaining steadfastly Hindu.

I and my friends were keenly interested in our visitor, had him for sleepovers, to dinner in our homes. We became friends and, on his departure, he invited us to return the visit.
  
> This, I was eager to do.   

I'd felt, from my earliest days, that the world was mine, belonged, personally, to me —that I should _explore_ it. See something of it. No pioneer, me; this was sheer _privilege_.

But I doubt our friend expected two of us to take him up on the offer, and so _soon_... 
<p> 
<br />
It was the very next year when, as highschool seniors, my good friend Scott Simpson

       alt="faithfulcrum logo">
</a>
and I spent a couple of winter months —taking advantage of the Christmas break and the blessing of our teachers— in that summer-like land.  
Traveling, singing and storytelling our way around the subcontinent gave me perhaps my first sense that these practices, honed in our homey church life, could take me to <i>that larger world I had so coveted.</i>
<br />
<br />
Scott and I remained lifelong friends and —our spiritual and religious paths having taken very different turns— discovered in recent years that we share much in common. In that open spirit, we co-create a biweekly podcast, <i>FaithFulcrum</i>.

## **The Boy in the Bands—** an incomplete list 

Before I get to the [_Great Band of my Life_](#howlooseanation), I should mention a handful of others, from a dozen examples.  

> NOTE: Sound Cloud appears to expect files compressed within an inch of their lives and normalized _right up to the red_. As I prefer what I like to call _Dymanic Range_ I urge the listener to crank the vol on the following embeds!

### Mister Tickle

In South Korea I fronted and wrote for _Mister Tickle_, a _jazzpunk_ trio of professors from England, Ireland and the US.  
We produced songs and performances appealing to the international _avant-garde_ set, in and around Seoul, notably congregating in a performance venue where I'd also perform solo —place known as <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/southkorea/globalcommunity/20230221/bulgasari-celebrates-20-years-of-experimental-music-in-seoul" target="_blank"><i>Bulgasari</i></a>— which, in Korean folklore, appears to be a kind of iron eating and entirely _unkillable_ monster.  
We were a rough, hard drinking bunch. It took me years to recover!

In 2015, through Australian arts organization _In Lak'esh,_ I was awarded an Artist's Residency Uniting Church, Katoomba, NSW, Australia. There, on the newly restored, century old pipe organ, I composed music for _Alice in Wonderland_.  
Joined by long-time collaborator Skye Evans, on double bass and backup vocals, I visited Alice upon Oz in a thunderous manner! The audience was filled with children, some of whom you can hear clapping along...  
I should note that the story Skye tells to introduce the encore, _No Such Place as America_, is entirely true in all its particulars. 


### Rope Smokin' Roy the Hair Farmer & his Orphans of the Storm Band

I met Rope Smokin Roy —as a matter of course— in a little bar in Little Falls, NY. We hit it off over a shared love of Bluegrass and _mountain music_.  
When he learned I'd been teaching myself to play the banjo, he recruited me, _note unheard_, to <a href="http://archive.today/2026.02.21-164359/https://www.uticaod.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/09/27/music-column-how-rope-smokin/9768770007/" target="_blank">play in his band</a> (that's me, on the trunk) in his upcoming, inaugural, _Bluegrass, Bikes and BBQ_ festival.  
Which I did.  

Me and the Orphans toured biker events, county fairs, backyard parties and bars in the region right up until the world closed down in 2020.  
What you'll hear at the link is my attempt to spin off a studio version of the same sort, during lockdown. I called myself _Col. Roadhard and the Putaway Wet_ and took advantage of tuba chops earned when I helped Lubbock Christian Highschool win State Champion in marching band, Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS) in 1983.  

Somehow recording at home, alone, eventually pushed me into less public and more private places as a performer. Today I consider the songs I produce like collections of soiled rags, waved about like crummy puppets. I learned to stitch so loosely, as creative director for:

### HOWLOOSEANATION, the band that made me what I am {: #howlooseanation }

I spent 15 years as Artistic Director with this ever-changing _performance heptet_ —the only constant's being myself and co-founder Dr. Fred Mausolf of Lincoln, Nebraska, prominent eye surgeon, painter and performer as well as long time patron of the arts.  
Over the years we welcomed more than 20 performers into our ranks, all still lifelong members.  
We composed and performed for television (NETV's documentary <del>[_Torn Notebook_](////)</del>, on the life and work of Claes Oldenburg), devised theatrical events with participation by The Flaming Cupcakes (Lincoln, Nebraska's notorious drag ensemble), Presented, live, a new score for the classic of silent cinema _Der Golem_ (1920).  
Our final show, _The Long Count_ premiered at the Montreal Fringe in 2007.

It was my extra-curricular work with HOWLOOSEANATION, however, that saw me enrolled, early in the 21st Century, at the (then) premier Arts Grad Program in the nation, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, as a _Performance Artist_.  
Once there, I immediately switched to _Art and Tech_... Though I managed to retain student work in both programs, graduating  with the "Leadership Award."
