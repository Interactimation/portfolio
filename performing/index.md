## **Where Writing and Making Meet** is in Performance, my oldest practice

Raised by shape note singers, in a fundamentalist and very-much _fellow_-ship, I, from an early age, performed _live, on stage_ —whether reading the scripture for the Sunday Sermon or leading the _a cappella_ singing (in four part harmony) for which my sect was famous...  
Or, my favorite, as part of the _puppet ministry_ of Vacation Bible School, I have been before audiences since I was in short pants.   

As a puppet (I named him Melvin J. Pickles) I learned to improvise. It was in this persona that I devised, on the spot, my first joke.  
I used to torture the live MC with my bants, and in one memorable moment, the kid, just a few years older than me, complained comically: 

Mr. Pickles, you're gonna give me a complex!  
To which, in the moment, I replied: 

> Aw, you're too _simple_ to have a _complex_! 

And, ok, now that I write it out, I feel like I copped it from an episode of _The Jeffersons_, but what a moment! It _sold_ me. I'd _paralyzed_ the guy!

It was my extra-curricular work with HOWLOOSEANATION, however, that saw me enrolled, early in the 21st Century, at the (then) premier Arts Grad Program in the nation, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, as a _Performance Artist_.  
Once there, I immediately switched to _Art and Tech_... Though I managed to retain student work in both programs, graduating  with the "Leadership Award."
