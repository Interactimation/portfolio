## **Where Writing and Making Meet** is in Performance, my oldest practice

Raised by shape note singers, in a fundamentalist and very-much _fellow_-ship, I, from an early age, performed _live, on stage_ —whether reading the scripture for the Sunday Sermon or leading the _a cappella_ singing (in four part harmony) for which our sect is justly famous...  
Or, a favorite, as part of the _puppet ministry_ of Vacation Bible School, I have been before audiences since I was in short pants.   

As a puppeteer (I named my alter ego _Melvin J. Pickles_) I learned to improvise. It was in this persona that I devised, on the spot, my first joke.  
While torturing the live MC with my _bants_ the kid —just a couple years older than me— complained comically: 
_Mr. Pickles, you're gonna give me a_ complex!  
In the moment, I replied: 

> Aw, you're too _simple_ to have a _complex_! 

And, ok, now that I write it out, I feel like I copped it from an episode of _The Jeffersons_, but what a moment! It _sold_ me. I'd _paralyzed_ the guy!

## **Singing and Storytelling** in the US and Abroad  

As I approached my highschool graduation, I qualified to join the Texas All State Choir at about the same time that I was planning a trip to India. The decision wasn't difficult.  

A couple years earlier an exchange student from _Andhra Pradesh_ had spent a year with our weird little Christian School, while remaining steadfastly Hindu. I and my friends took him under our wing. On his departure he invited us to return the visit.

I don't know that he expected two of us to take him up on it, but in our senior year <del>[Scott Simpson](////)</del> and I spent a couple of the winter months, taking advantage of the Christmas break —and the blessing of our teachers— in that summer-like land. Traveling, singing and storytelling, it was my first sense that these activities, honed in our homey church life, could take me _elsewhere_.

## **The Boy in the Band—** an incomplete list 

Before I get to the _Great Band of my Life_ I should mention some others.

It was my extra-curricular work with HOWLOOSEANATION, however, that saw me enrolled, early in the 21st Century, at the (then) premier Arts Grad Program in the nation, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, as a _Performance Artist_.  
Once there, I immediately switched to _Art and Tech_... Though I managed to retain student work in both programs, graduating  with the "Leadership Award."
