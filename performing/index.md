## **Where Writing and Making Meet** is in Performance, my oldest practice

Raised by shape note singers, in a fundamentalist and very-much _fellow_-ship, I, from an early age, performed _live, on stage_ —whether reading the scripture for the Sunday Sermon or leading _a cappella_ singing (in four part harmony) for which our sect is justly famous...  
Or, a favorite, as part of the _puppet ministry_ of Vacation Bible School, I have been, all unseen, before audiences since I was in short pants.   

As a puppeteer (naming my alter ego _Melvin J. Pickles_) I learned to improvise. It was in this persona that I devised, on the spot, my first joke...

While torturing the live MC with my _bants_ the kid —just a couple years older than me— complained comically: 
_Mr. Pickles, you're gonna give me a_ complex!  
In the moment, I replied: 

> Aw, you're too _simple_ to have a _complex_! 

And, ok, now that I write it out, I feel like I copped it from an episode of _The Jeffersons_, but what a moment! It _sold_ me. I'd _paralyzed_ the guy!

## **Singing and Storytelling:** the US and Abroad  

In the approach to my highschool graduation, I qualified to join the Texas All State Choir at about the same time I'd planned a trip to India. The decision wasn't difficult.  

A couple years earlier, an exchange student from _Andhra Pradesh_ had spent a year in our weird little Christian School —while remaining steadfastly Hindu.

I and my friends welcomed him, had him for sleepovers, to dinner in our homes. We took an interest in our visitor from the far side of the globe!  
On his departure, he invited us to return the visit.
  
> This, I was eager to do.   

I'd felt, from my earliest days, that the world was mine —that I should _explore_ it. See something of it.  
No pioneer, me; it was sheer _privilege_.

But I doubt our friend expected two of us to take him up on the offer, and so _soon_...

It was the very next year when, as highschool seniors, my good friend Scott Simpson

</a>
and I spent a couple of winter months —taking advantage of the Christmas break and the blessing of our teachers— in that summer-like land.  
Traveling, singing and storytelling our way around the subcontinent gave me perhaps my first sense that these practices, honed in our homey church life, could take me to _that larger world I had so coveted_.

## **The Boy in the Bands—** an incomplete list 

Before I get to the <del>[_Great Band of my Life_]()</del>, I should mention some others:

In South Korea I fronted <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mistertickle/elephantiasis_blues" target="_blank">Mister Tickle</a>, a _jazzpunk_ trio of professors from England, Ireland and the US.

It was my extra-curricular work with HOWLOOSEANATION, however, that saw me enrolled, early in the 21st Century, at the (then) premier Arts Grad Program in the nation, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, as a _Performance Artist_.  
Once there, I immediately switched to _Art and Tech_... Though I managed to retain student work in both programs, graduating  with the "Leadership Award."
