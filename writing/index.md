## Playwright is a word, like wheelwright, shipwright

My very first teaching gig —outside Sunday School, that kind of thing— came in my early 20s at Johns Hopkins' Center for Talented Youth, or CTY. There I served as _teaching assistant_ in Playwriting and the Essay form, and got to do solo "units" in each. To date, my favorite gig.
