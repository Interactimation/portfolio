## **Playwright is a Word,** like wheelwright, shipwright

My very first teaching gig —outside Sunday School, that kind of thing— came in my early 20s at Johns Hopkins' Center for Talented Youth, or _CTY_. There I served as Teaching Assistant in _Playwriting_, which I'd studied at Texas Tech University, and _The Essay_ of which I knew nothing— beyond having read Montaigne. Nevertheless, I got to offer solo "units" in each.  
To date, one of my favorite gigs.

## **By then I'd Already Toured** with a sketch comedy troupe

_A Going Concern_ targeted youth camps, clubs, churches and whatnot. We wrote our own material, traveled thousands of miles a week, slept —six of us— in a van. We ate fast food, drank nothing but soda as we crisscrossed the nation.  
In the Rockies, my first crossing of the continental divide, I jumped out: _Never peed in the Pacific!_ I shouted, before noticing my urine was bright orange.  
It's amazing any of us lived. Need I say, it's all a bit of a blur?

## **Proctor of Performance -OR-** a band is like a marriage

For more than fifteen years with my performance "heptet" HOWLOOSEANATION, I served as _Artistic Director_. I wrote songs, scenarios, the libretto of our operetta _The Long Count_, which premiered at the Montreal Fringe in 2007.  
Based on the (then) coming end of the Mayan Calendar, _Scientists, detecting the unraveling of time itself, desperately strove to reverse its flow..._ 
Which, of course, is now clearly occurring!  

## **Lame Claim to Fame:** my time in TV-Land 

As a Producer for MeTV in Chicago —then, a little mom-and-pop joint— I created interactives, promotions, performed voice-overs, retroscripting "classic" TV shows into new jokes, deconstructed narratives. It's the low-power station with the largest audience: cunningly placing its antenna atop the Hancock building to reach all Chicagoland. Later, licensing to cable took it nationwide. That's right: I know Svengoolie!

## **Producer, Production, Product,** that inevitable declension
