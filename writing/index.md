## **Playwright is a Word,** like wheelwright, shipwright

My very first teaching gig, outside Sunday School, that kind of thing, came in my early 20s at Johns Hopkins' Center for Talented Youth, or _CTY_. There I served as Teaching Assistant in _Playwriting_ —which I'd studied at Texas Tech University— and _The Essay_, of which I knew nothing beyond having read _Montaigne_.  
Nevertheless, I offered solo "units" in each. To date, one of my favorite gigs.

## **By then I'd Already Toured** with a sketch comedy troupe

_A Going Concern_ targeted youth camps, clubs, churches and whatnot. We wrote our own material, traveled thousands of miles per week, slept —all five of us, and a driver— in one van. We ate fast food, drank nothing but soda as we crisscrossed the nation.  
In the Rockies, my first crossing of the continental divide, I jumped out, shouting: _Never peed in the Pacific!_  
Before noticing my urine was bright orange.  
It's amazing any of us lived.  
Need I say, it's all a bit of a blur?

## **Proctor of Performance -OR-** A band is like a marriage

For more than fifteen years with my performance "heptet" HOWLOOSEANATION, I served as _Artistic Director_. I wrote songs, scenarios, the libretto of our operetta _The Long Count_, which premiered at the Montreal Fringe in 2007.  
Inspired by the (then) coming end of the Mayan Calendar:  
> _Scientists, detecting the unraveling of time itself, desperately strive to reverse its flow..._  

Which, of course, is now _clearly occurring_! 

## **Journeyman Journalist —** my decade at the DN 
During those same years (I only lived in Linocln for 12 of these) I became sort of _world famous in Lincoln, Nebraska_— a line which has gotten laughs as far away as Seoul, Korea. When I found out the rag _paid_ I was in the office like a shot. The Johnny Carson black box was brand new in those days and brought in a ton of experimental dance. "Who wants to be the _dance writer_?" was a question I could only answer with, _Yo._ 

By the end of the decade (I worked for a living, y'all, no nepo baby, me!) I'd been a reporter, section editor, I'd  drawn op-ed cartoons and generally mentored generations of writers, artists and the many and various ne'er-do-wells and drunks attracted by the pittance paid.

## **"Studying" Writing is Like** "practicing" surgery  

Perhaps because of this, I was granted some _special dispensation_ to take graduate-level writing courses, as an undergrad, at one of the midwest's (then) premier MFA programs. I took _all_ of them.   
It was my extra-curricular work with HOWLOOSEANATION, however, that saw me enrolled, early in the 21st Century, at the (then) premier Arts Grad Program in the nation, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, as a Performance Artist. Once there, however, I immediately switched to Art and Tech... Though I managed to retain student work in both programs, graduating  with the "Leadership Award." 

## **Lame Claim to Fame:** my time in TV-Land 

As a Producer for MeTV in Chicago —in those days quite the mom-and-pop joint, with its own "big guy" in the corner office— I created interactives, promotions, performed voice-overs, and largely retroscripted "classic" TV shows into new jokes, deconstructed narratives.  
It was the low-power station with the nation's largest audience: cunningly placing its antennae atop the Hancock building, reaching all Chicagoland.  
Later, licensing to cable took it nationwide. That's right: I know _Svengoolie_!

## **Producer, Production, Product,** that inevitable declension
