## **Playwright is a Word,** like wheelwright, shipwright

My very first teaching gig, outside Sunday School, that kind of thing, came in my early 20s at the Johns Hopkins <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/cty-experience" target="_blank">Center for Talented Youth, or _CTY_</a>.  
There I served as Teaching Assistant in _Playwriting_ —which I'd studied at Texas Tech University— and _The Essay_, of which I knew nothing beyond having read _Montaigne_.  
Nevertheless, I offered solo "units" in each. To date, one of my favorite gigs.  

I've since taught screenplay and playwriting in places as diverse as [Chicago and South Korea](////) but my writing chops have somewhat expanded in the mean time. 

<br />

## **I Got my Start, Years Before,** touring the country with a sketch comedy troupe

_A Going Concern_ targeted youth camps, clubs, churches (nothing "blue", all "positive energy") and whatnot.  
We wrote our own material, traveled thousands of miles per week, slept —five young people and a driver— in one van. We ate fast food, drank nothing but soda as we crisscrossed the nation.  

In the Rockies, my first crossing of the continental divide, I jumped out, shouting— _Never peed in the Pacific!_ —before noticing my urine was bright orange.  
It's amazing any of us lived. Need I say: it's a bit of a blur?

<br />

## **Proctor of Performance -OR-** A band is like a marriage

For more than fifteen years with my [performance "heptet" HOWLOOSEANATION](////), I served as _Artistic Director_.  
<p>
<a href="{{ "/pix/LongCountPressArt.jpg" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">
  <img class="thumb-left"
       src="{{ "/pix/LongCountPressArt_thumb.jpg" | relative_url }}"
       alt="long count poster">
</a>

I wrote press releases, composed songs, devised scenarios.  
I penned the libretto for our operetta, <i>The Long Count</i> —this was the show that premiered at the Montreal Fringe in 2007.  
I'd been inspired by the (then) approaching end of the Mayan Calendar.  
My sci-fi premise:</p>
 
> _Scientists, detecting the unraveling of time itself, desperately strive to reverse its flow..._  

All of which is now, of course, _clearly occurring_! 

<br />

## **Journeyman Journalist —** my decade at the DN 

During those same years I became sort of _world famous in Lincoln, Nebraska_— a line which has gotten laughs as far away as Seoul, South Korea.  
When I found out The Rag (affectionate nickname of _The Daily Nebraskan_) actually _paid_, well I was in the office _like a shot_.  
The Johnny Carson black box theater was spanking new in those days and brought in a metric tons of experimental dance.
<a href="https://nebnewspapers.unl.edu/lccn/sn96080312/1992-01-20/ed-1/seq-6/" target="_blank">Who wants to be the <i>dance writer</i>?</a> was a question I could only answer with: _Yo._ 

By the end of the decade (part-time student, I worked for a living, y'all. No nepo baby, me!) I'd been a reporter, a section editor, served on the _Publications Board_.  
I'd  drawn op-ed cartoons, written headlines and generally mentored generations of writers, artists and the many and various ne'er-do-wells and drunkards attracted by the pittance of a remittance.

<br />

## **"Studying" Writing is Like** "practicing" surgery  

Perhaps because of this, I was granted some _special dispensation_ to take graduate-level writing courses as an undergrad, at one of the midwest's (then) premier MFA programs.  
I took [_all_ of them](////). 
At some point, inspired by They Might be Giants' _Dial-A-Song_ project, I launched <a href="https://nebnewspapers.unl.edu/lccn/sn96080312/1995-02-20/ed-1/seq-9/" target="_blank">StoryLine,</a> a call-in, storytelling service —new recordings daily— for a full year.  

No lesser light than Allen Ginsberg called in to encourage me in this experiment that definitively built the machine in my brain which spits out pithy prose.  
To this day, with a little lubrication —_braaaat!_ —out pops a paragraph!   

<br />

## **Lame Claim to Fame:** my time in TV-Land 

As a Producer for MeTV in Chicago —in those days quite the mom-and-pop joint, with its own _big guy in the corner office_— I created interactives, promotions, performed voice-overs.
I largely retroscripted "classic" TV shows into <a href="https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=BxWFd7ul5ao" target="_blank">new jokes, deconstructed narratives.</a>  
This was the low-power station with the nation's largest audience —cunningly placing its antennae atop the Hancock building, it reached all Chicagoland.  

Later, licensing to cable took MeTV nationwide. That's right: I know _Svengoolie_! Last ghoul  standing of the great american Horror Hosts.

<br />

## **Producer, Production, Product,** that inevitable declension

Thus I entered the realm of "interactive marketing," serving as producer on innovative projects for Fortune 100 clients like Diageo.  

With _Publicis Groupe_ I helped create, for thebar​.com, —a long defunct, Flash-based, live action bartenter who remembered you from _last_ time, took drink orders, commented on the weather in your location (called you by name —if it appeared on a list of hundreds) and told ribald stories, cracking insider jokes.  
This won a national award for innovation, though those who remember Burger King's down-low promotion, the frenetic <a href="https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=rGjtE_SOn70" target="_blank"><i>Subservient Chicken</i></a> will be familiar with the technical concept.  
Our bartender was a bit like that only, for him, we wrote _fifteen hundred_ wittily interlocking scripts! 

<br/>

## **A Loose Unsyndicate —** I create community 

It may have been some premonition of the coming slowdown that saw me complete, in early 2020, my first _short story_ in many years.  
Immediately, as the governor of New York closed down our universities, I reached out to literally _everyone I knew_ who'd ever earned a dollar from their writing, trying to put together a writer's group.  
I found _one_.  
Who later _brought_ one.  
Today, _A Loose Unsyndicate_ (named, at our first meeting, by combining an adjective and a derived noun) still meets every week and boasts six-and-a-half constant contributors.  
And though the membership is not exactly secret, I have sworn never to reveal the coordinates of that ashram.  
Some of us have sold cartoons and other content to _The New Yorker_, one manages the social media of a prominent video game studio.  
A graduate of Chicago's Second City writing program is a member, as is an entrepreneur whose business provides interactive narrative learning content to American schools.  
One is a full member of SFWA.  

That's me. I'm that guy.

## **Membership Hath Privilege —** I go pro

That first short story, after 20 years of _every other_ kind of writing, produced its progeny of dozens. Though it has yet to sell (I'm working on it!) many of its children were picked up and paid for. 
While I'd fancied myself a _magic realist_ while stapling my 1990s _zines_ together (my _Homunculus_ lived atop toilet tanks all over the city, its little stories the perfect length for reflection) this, these, are clearly _speculative_, most falling squarely in the Science Fiction sandbox.  
I've sold to _Asimov's_, _Analog_, _The Fabulist_ and bunches of others —earning enough in sales to qualify and finally join The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association, better known by its ancinet monicker, the _Science Fiction Writers of America_. 

Rather than tell you about it, I'd have you visit [my brutalist, hand-coded writer's site](https://www.donmarkbaldridge.com/).  
There, most of the cover art images link to the online stories —exceptions being print-only titles. As the embargoes lift on republication, I expect to be linking to some sort of document. 
I just don't want it to look like ANSI A paper in double-spaced Times New Roman!

## **Screenplay as Playform —** Playcrazy after all these years 

Haven't done much like _theatre_ since the Plague (early 2020s) but I have the sense that my future as a playwright might lie in _animation_.  
As an animator, I'm a puppeteer, and as a puppeteer, an actor, improvisor, _writer_. And I like writing for actors...  
So this is new, and actually _has_ to —due to the strict exigencies of the screenplay format— appear in an 8.5/11" white slab. It's meant to commemorate (and exploit) a property that has never _not_ made money: _Popeye_, that spinach-snarfing sailorman, made his glorious entrance into the public domain in 2025!  
I got to wondering if there was something in OLD Popeye —and then I remembered: we already got one!  
Folks, I give you: [_Poop Deck Pappy!_](SailormanEp001.pdf)
